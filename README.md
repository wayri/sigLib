# sigLib
A basic signal processing and control library for basic implementation of filters and controllers

## Approach

The approach for this library is to provide a simple function style frontend for several filter implementations and controller implementations, to make designing control loops easy and simple.

And loops require a few parts, this library provides a few basic ones. 
- It includes a filter
- A saturation function
- A level trigger
- A watchdog style 2 level window monitor
- A PID controller
- PID antiwindup
- error computation

It also includes a few pre-designed loops, for which parameters like gains and filter types can be selected by the user. This allows for rapidly testing plant control
